# FIN-C2-070 — Financial Advisory Call Compliance & Suitability Check Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (orchestrates multiple steps to accomplish a specific use case)
> **Industry**: FIN

## Overview

Audits a recorded financial-advisory call for suitability-rule compliance. The request is a JSON
object with the path to an MP3 or WAV recording and an optional jurisdiction profile; other
formats are rejected, as is personal data found outside the audio.

The workflow transcribes the call and splits it by speaker through an injected transcription
service (masking personal identifiers), classifies each utterance through an injected language
model, checks deterministically whether risk disclosure and customer-profile confirmation took
place, and looks for forbidden guarantee phrases. The output is a verdict per check with
evidence timestamps, an overall verdict (compliant, needs_review or violation) and a disclaimer
that it is not legal advice. The temporary audio file is deleted afterwards.

No transcription service, language model or vector store is bundled. You supply them through
the graph configuration. When one is not configured, the workflow degrades explicitly instead of
pretending to have it:

- **No transcriber:** the request may carry an already-transcribed call as a `transcript` list
  (`speaker`, `text`, `start_ts`, `end_ts`; at most 500 utterances of 2,000 characters each). It is
  masked the same way. With neither a transcriber nor a `transcript`, the run ends in an error.
- **No language model:** utterances are classified by a coarse keyword baseline. Every such result
  is labelled `method: keyword_fallback`, so it is not mistaken for the model's judgment.
- **No vector store:** the retrieval step is skipped and recorded in the audit trace. The
  deterministic checks run as usual, since they never depended on retrieval.

The standalone server (`src/api/server.py`) injects none of the three, apart from a language model
built from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when that key is set. Without further wiring it therefore runs the
fallback path above.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | 3.11 or later |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and test specification
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
